<h1 align="center"><u><strong>Welcome to my GitHub</strong></u></h1>

My name is Brandon Thery and I am the creator of Star Envy. I am currently studying supply chain & logistics and marketing at Rowan University. Outside of that I like to create things in the form of "vibe coding", though I hate the term. You may have guessed that most of the code on this profile is generated by AI rather than written by a human- I have no professional CS background and can only write in English.
